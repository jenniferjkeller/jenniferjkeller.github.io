      <h3 class="d-flex justify-content-center center-head">Summary</h3>
        <p>Seven percent of the US population must avoid gluten due to Celiac disease, and thirty percent of all shoppers seek out gluten free options for health reasons and sensitivities. Shoppers face cost prohibitiveness, unfamiliar products, and confusion over adapting recipes when making these choices. Flourish is an organic fairtrade B-corp built to solve these issues and more.  </p>

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>Initially, this product started as a specialty foods website.  I conducted a user survey that yielded 31 responses. Nearly half of respondents reported they only purchased specialty food items for special occasions or for gifts.  The other half revealed themselves as my target base, people aged 25-44 working in the arts and service industries who purchase specialty items at least once a month. Results of this survey can be found <a class="form-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11TvxhqR0hnw0JemSpt8sg6thwFM0eKDrZRVYNaFfaxM/edit#responses" >here</a>.</p>

        <p>After narrowing the scope of the project to target users avoiding gluten and those interested in alternative flours, I conducted <a class="form-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xbP8Tfa2yE4dMK2oyzjU52_GZ8yiLHX_ogbtiwpqcFk/edit#responses" >another</a> user survey that revealed significant pain points: high cost, limited availability, and  inconsistent results. From this data, I determined Flourish's main offerings.</p>
        <p>Rounding out my research, I used information I'd read about how millenials spend to gauge whether or not a social component would be a successful part of brand definition.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container col-md-8">
        <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
        <p>The first sites I explored broadly encompassed the specialty food genre.  They appeared dated and clunky, with unelegant filter functionality.  I also discovered a couple more modern sites that focused on a subscription box model. These sites boasted curated collections and loads of whitespace, elements I carried into my design.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>Early on when the focus was still broad, I used an open card sort to assist with categorization and filtration of products. The similarity matrix and dendograms were helpful ways to view the data set and create groups of similar products. </p>
        <button class="btn btn-outline userflow-button"><a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/q0262mj2/150g05d6/shared-results/68p8i3cth16o556ldv4w0i2538njm55b	"><span>View Results </span></a></button>

        <p class="ia-p">To help define the scope and layout of the project I diagrammed the five primary ways users would interact with the product.  This overview helped me visualize the steps users would take and the different pathways they could go to get from A to B.</p>

         <h3>Wireframes</h3>
         <p>When determining the layout style, I ran through several iterations of wireframes. In the earliest versions, I sketched quickly to explore different  configurations. Next, I created a paper prototype, and then the hi-fi versions, which went through three iterations based on user preference, A/B testing and critiques.</p>

        <div class="container col-md-8">
          <h3>Branding work</h3>
          <p>I began by creating a design system in order to build in consistency and scalability. The design system consists of a typescale, brand colors, and button styles.</p>
          <img class="branding img-fluid mb-5" src="img/styleguide-2.jpg" alt="style guide with colors and design components">

          <p>I brainstormed several names and narrowed it down to four which I sent out to my Facebook friends and Slack groups for a vote.  Flourish was the clear winner, with Wild Flour coming in second. Once the name was determined, I got to work on designing a logo.</p>

          <p>In the earliest stages, I experimented with typeface and style. Originally, I thought a brush typeface would work well, but ultimately it didn't look clean or modern enough.  The second iteration was an improvement, but the grain image was mistaken for wheat by numerous testers which wouldn't do for a gluten-free business, sending me back to work.</p>
          <img class="branding img-fluid" src="/img/flourish-early-logo.jpg" alt="Flourish logo iterations">


          <p>In the final iteration the brand identity became more clear, focusing on the B-corp and the close working relationship with the farmers. The final version also took care of the grain misidentification because all of flourish's products begin as seedlings, whether they'll grow to be grains or coconut palms. The final germinating seedling logo is representative of what it means to flourish and thrive, and feels fresh and hopeful.</p>

        <div class="container col-md-8 mb-5">
          <h3>User testing results</h3>
          <p>I ran user tests on the second versions of the logo and determined they did not convey the product well.</p>
          <p>I ran an A/B preference test on two landing pages wireframes and continued to the hifi design of the version most selected.</p>
        <p>Finally, I observed a user navigating through the prototype with a set of tasks to complete.  The user was able to sign up for an account, browse products, and progress through the checkout flow easily.  Observing this user, I determined that the filters needed an additional indicator for selection.  I added a checkbox to the left of each filter option that, when checked, adds the filter to a breadcrumb style list showing those applied.</p>

Flourish is a responsive ecommerce site designed to meet the needs of users no matter what device they are on. I designed the site using a scalable design system to allow for easy additions as the business grows.  I used a soft and sophisticated monochrome color palette with bold images highlighting the company's mission of shared humanity and care for each other, whether that means attending to a food allergy or sensitivity, or ensuring tht the people who made the product possible have a better standard of living. The product was created as part of my apprenticeship program and did not ship. </p>
