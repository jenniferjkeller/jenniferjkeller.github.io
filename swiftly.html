        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p>I conducted interviews with members of the community asking what features they wanted in a bike-sharing service and how often they would use it. People reported they would use the bike while visiting or getting around the city. They liked that it was cheaper than public transportation or a rental car.</p>
        <p>With the old service, having to bring the bike back to a specified hub was a common complaint. People also reported that the bikes didn't have many gears.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="container col-md-8">
        <h3>Competitive analysis</h3>
        <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of two bike-share companies in Seattle and one company that does business nationwide. I researched the equipment used in bike sharing and examined the apps used to obtain the service. From this research, I gleaned several important insights. </p>

            <p>I mapped out a user flow based on Rachel’s first time using the app, but the early stages were too complex. The user had to complete several steps before creating an account, all before they got to see how many bikes were nearby. Given that users may be at the bike, ready to scan and ride, this user flow was insufficient.  It was re-worked and streamlined for the final design.</p>

          <h3>Branding work</h3>
          <p>In the branding phase, I created a mind map to brainstorm a name. I selected "Swiftly" because it connotes movement and speed. Next, I developed the tagline “Where the better bikes are” to educate users about the higher quality bikes available in our fleet. The user swipes through screens promoting premium features to reinforce the product's quality. </p>

          <p>I originally selected a palette of blues for Swiftly's branding. In testing, the palette was seen as cold and corporate, even dated. I brightened up the palette to feature a friendlier blend of purples with a desaturated jade green accent that provides depth and richness in the surrounding whitespace. </p>

          <img class="branding img-fluid" src="img/swatches.jpg" alt="color palette">
          <br></br>

          <p>I wanted the logo to convey movement, but it also had to be legible from a distance. I included stylized lines coming from the top of the S so the appearance conveys swiftness, whether the user sees the fast S logo, or Swiftly in its long form. </p>

          <h3>User testing results</h3>
          <p>Users did not have any trouble renting a bike.  There was some confusion over creating an account which led me to revise the conversion funnel.  The user is now guided to create an account after scanning to ride, touching to reserve, or clicking the CTA. The product is ready to ship and subject to further testing. </p>
